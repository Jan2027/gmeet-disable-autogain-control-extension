# Disable Auto Gain Control for Google Meet (Chrome Extension)

This chrome extension disables the automatic gain control that Google Meet
enables on your microphone. I built this extension when I discovered that the
gain on my Blue Yeti microphone was automatically rising when I talked in
meetings, and there did not seem to be any system configuration which prevented
this from happening.

It's possible that this extension could be generalized to allow for toggling
other audio/video settings within Google Meet or disabling autogain in other
applications, but it satisfies my use cases for now.
